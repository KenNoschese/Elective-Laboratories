Activity was great. I learned the elements of graphic design. 
It was an enlightening experience where I was able to train and improve my skills in the realm of graphic design. 
I learned how important composition is and just how necessary or essential design is in our day-to-day living. 
This was a great step in my journey to learning design. 
Great!
