The design principle I found most useful was visual hierarchy, as it allowed me to strategically use size and contrast to ensure my career goals and technical skills stood out clearly. 
Utilizing Canva’s integrated layout elements and grids was the easiest part of the process, though fine-tuning the alignment and white space to achieve a professional, uncluttered look was the most challenging. 
This activity taught me that visual communication is not just about aesthetics, but about using structure to make information easier for an audience to process. 
As a CS student, I now realize how essential these principles are for creating user-friendly interfaces and clear project documentation. 
The experience was enlightening, helping me bridge the gap between technical data and effective presentation. 
Overall, this was a significant step in my journey toward mastering functional and appealing digital design.
