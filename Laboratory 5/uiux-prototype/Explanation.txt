The app is named Nexus and its purpose is simple. A unified interface for all tasks. I'm a student and a big challenge I face is organizing tasks which is why I came up with Nexus. 
The target users are students, most especially university students and the program aims to increase their efficiency and save time without sacrificing any deadlines. 
The layout and colors of the program is simple and minimal designed to not overclutter the brain and simply stick to what is necessary. 
The challenge was trying to create a unified hub that aggregates massive amounts of academic data without overwhelming the user visually. 
I struggled to establish a clear information hierarchy that could display deadlines, recommendations, and other elements simultaneously while maintaining the "breathable" whitespace. 
Given more time, I'll probably add more features that would improve the overall feel such as dark mode, a timer for the focus functionality, and some more UI changes probably.
